# ODNet
This is the code for our papers: An Object Detection Model for Power Lines with Occlusions Combining CNN and Transformer.

This model is proposed besed on YOLO X-s, the YOLO X-s code is obtained from Bubbliiiing in Bilibili: https://github.com/bubbliiiing/yolox-pytorch.

The pretrained weight can also be finded in the above website. You can also download the weight in: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1xI5y9qWCPrY-R0ALL_n5ZA?pwd=1234
